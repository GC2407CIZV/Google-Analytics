## 1. Project Overview

The wellness technology market is booming, and Bellabeat is positioned to capitalize on this growth with its beautifully designed, health-focused products. This project provides data-driven insights into user behavior related to activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure, which are crucial for developing effective marketing strategies for the Leaf wellness tracker.

## 2. Skills

* **Programming:** R (with tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, readr, and R Markdown)
* **Data Analysis:** Data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, data visualization
* **Business Acumen:** Translating data insights into actionable business recommendations, strategic thinking, marketing strategy development, market research interpretation
* **Communication:**  Clearly communicating technical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences (demonstrated through the R Markdown report and this README).
* **Tools:** RStudio (Posit Cloud), Version Control (Git - *add if applicable*), Project Management (e.g. Trello - *add if applicable*)

## 3. Business Context

Bellabeat aims to empower women through beautifully designed health-focused products. The Leaf tracker is a key product in their portfolio, and understanding user behavior related to activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure is critical for maximizing its market potential. This project addresses the need for data-driven marketing strategies to effectively reach the target audience and promote the Leaf's unique features.

## 4. Data & Methodology

**Data Source:** Publicly available Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data from Kaggle.

**Data Characteristics:** Minute-level data on activity, heart rate, and sleep from 30 Fitbit users, including daily and hourly summaries.

**Data Limitations:** The small sample size (30 users) and potential biases in self-reported data limit the generalizability of the findings.  The data originates from Fitbit users, not Bellabeat customers, requiring an assumption of similar usage patterns. These limitations are acknowledged and considered in the analysis and recommendations.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preparation:** Data was loaded, inspected, cleaned, transformed, and merged using R and the `tidyverse` package.  Date/time variables were formatted using `lubridate`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  EDA was performed to uncover trends and patterns in the data.  This included descriptive statistics, data visualization using `ggplot2`, and correlation analysis.
3. **Strategic Recommendations:**  Based on the EDA, actionable marketing recommendations were developed for Bellabeat's Leaf product.

## 5. Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

*(This section should be populated with your actual findings and recommendations.  Quantify your findings whenever possible.  Here are some examples - **replace these with your own!**)*

* **Sedentary Behavior:**  75% of users spend more than 8 hours per day in sedentary activities.  **Recommendation:** Position the Leaf as a tool to combat sedentary behavior, emphasizing features like movement reminders and activity tracking.
* **Sleep & Activity Correlation:**  A weak positive correlation (r = 0.2) was found between sleep duration and total active minutes. **Recommendation:**  While promoting the importance of both sleep and activity, avoid implying a strong causal link. Focus on personalized insights and recommendations for optimizing both.
* **Weekend Activity Spike:**  Users take, on average, 20% more steps on weekends compared to weekdays.  **Recommendation:** Develop weekend-specific challenges and promotional offers to capitalize on this trend.

## 6. Next Steps & Impact

* **A/B Testing:**  Implement A/B testing on marketing campaigns and app features to measure their effectiveness and optimize user engagement.
* **User Feedback Integration:**  Collect and analyze user feedback to inform product development and marketing strategies.
* **Predictive Modeling:**  Explore the use of machine learning to predict user behavior and personalize recommendations.  *(Mention this only if you have relevant experience/interest.)*
* **Impact Measurement:** Track key metrics (e.g., website traffic, app downloads, sales) to assess the impact of the implemented recommendations.

## 7. Conclusion

This data-driven analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and informs strategic recommendations for Bellabeat's Leaf product. By focusing on the identified trends and implementing the recommended actions, Bellabeat can effectively target its marketing efforts, enhance user engagement, and drive growth in the competitive wellness technology market.
