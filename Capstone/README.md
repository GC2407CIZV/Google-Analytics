## 1. Introduction

This case study uses Fitbit data to understand consumer wellness trends and provide data-driven marketing recommendations for Bellabeat's Leaf product.  The analysis explores activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure patterns to identify opportunities for product positioning and feature promotion.

## 2. Business Context

Bellabeat, a wellness technology company, aims to empower women through beautifully designed health-focused products.  This analysis supports Bellabeat's strategic decision-making by providing insights into consumer behavior and preferences in the wellness market.

## 3. Data Overview

The analysis uses publicly available Fitbit data from Kaggle, comprising minute-level data on activity, heart rate, and sleep from 30 users.

* **Weekday/Weekend Differences:** Potential differences in activity levels exist between weekdays and weekends, requiring further investigation for targeted engagement.
* **Activity Level Distribution:**  The distribution of activity levels (very active, fairly active, lightly active) varies across days of the week, suggesting the need for personalized activity recommendations.

### 4.2 Sleep Patterns

* **Sleep Duration Variation:** Sleep durations vary considerably, emphasizing the need for personalized sleep tracking and recommendations.
* **Sleep Time Distribution:**  A significant portion of users sleep between 5 and 10 hours, but there are notable segments who sleep less or more, highlighting diverse sleep patterns.

### 4.3 Correlations
